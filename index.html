            <h2 class="">Resilience &amp; Letting Go</h2> 
            
            <p>As young children in our beds at night, we may keep on a small light to ward off our fears. Growing a bit older, we may use a flashlight under the blanket to read a favorite book longer after we're supposed to be asleep in the darkness. In our childhood visions, we play heroes, dragons, sorcerers, and all sorts of imaginary roles through which we discover ourselves. Growing older as teens and into adulthood, aspects of our reality inevitably disappoint us.</p>
            <p>If we don't become lost souls, we find our pathways through life. If we're truly fortunate, we meet a mentor who nudges us forward. At some point, though it may take decades, we may learn that all we can control is how we respond to a situation.</p>
<blockquote>
"Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of human freedoms--to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way."
<cite>Viktor Frankl</cite>
</blockquote>
<p>For those who are parents, we learn there comes a time to let go, that our children will make their own mistakes, that we hope fate keeps them from tragedy, and that they learn to live <em>their</em> lives.
            </p>
            <p>Likewise, our compatriots of the wild, those animals we rarely see in reality, seemingly have mastered the art of living.</p>
            <blockquote>
                "The life of wild animals is a struggle for existence. The full exertion of all their faculties and all their energies is required to preserve their own existence and provide for that of their infant offspring."
                <cite>Alfred Russel Wallace</cite>
