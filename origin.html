            <h2 class="">The Origins of Nightlight Discovery</h2> 
            <p>In an odd way, the pandemic forged a closer bond between myself and my young daughter. She lives mostly with her mother, an hour away. With remote schooling during the pandemic, Mila spent many more weeks with me during the school year than normally possible.</p>
            <p>We both share a love of storytelling and games. Since preschool, she's been fascinated by the lives and behaviors of animals. Despite her young age, she has studied wildlife for years. And for years, she has told us when she grows up that she wants to teach people to care about animals and their environment (which is also our environment).</p>
            <p>Over many hours of conversations and playacting as animals together during the pandemic, she thought of a concept for a video game about a wolf pup lost in the woods who meet a firefly, who serves as a guide and mentor. She called this game Nightlight Discovery.</p>
            <p>When she first told me her idea, I thought of the universal stories and myths that guide us. Echoes of a college class on Dante rung out at me. Mila is beginning to grasp that she's tapping into the power of storytelling and the role of stories in our lives.</p>
            <p>During the pandemic, we played Ori and the Blind Forest for dozens of hours over the course of many afternoons, week after week: handing the controller back-and-forth as each of us took turns collaboratively figuring out the challenges and mastering the moves. If you know that game, you'll know that escaping the Ginzo tree is among the most challenging feats in any game ever. When we finally escaped the Ginzo tree in Ori and the Blind Forest, after many hours of trying, we hugged in an embrace I'll never forget.</p>
